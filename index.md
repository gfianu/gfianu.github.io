# Hi, I’m Godfred

![Brand image](assets/brand-1.jpg)

## Summary
I’m a Chemistry PhD and college professor building toward software engineering roles. I build web apps with **React**, write backend logic with **Java**, and work with **SQL** and data workflows. I enjoy projects that connect education, science, and technology.

## What I’m seeking
I’m seeking **software engineering** (or **full-stack**) opportunities where I can build polished user experiences, ship features iteratively, and collaborate on real products.

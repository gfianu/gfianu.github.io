## Summary
I’m a Chemistry PhD and college professor with a strong interest in building and applying software tools to scientific, educational, and data-driven problems. I develop web applications using **React**, implement backend logic with **Java**, and work with **SQL** and data workflows. My work often sits at the intersection of education, science, and technology, with a focus on clarity, usability, and impact.

## Focus
I am particularly interested in designing and building well-structured software projects, learning modern development workflows, and creating tools that support learning, analysis, and real-world problem solving.
